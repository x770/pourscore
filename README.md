# Pourscore
> Final Project: University of Richmond Full Stack Boot Camp 

## Overview
 Pourscore is a MERN stack single-page application that allows users to log their ratings of different beers. Other features of the app include the ability to add notes and photos to their entries.

 Pourscore is currently in rapid development. Please excuse the mess, but check back regularly to see the updates!
